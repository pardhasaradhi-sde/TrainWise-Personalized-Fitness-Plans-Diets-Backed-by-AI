2. ‚úÖ **Exercise Selection Based on Level**
   - **Beginner**: Bodyweight, machine-based, or simple movements  
   - **Intermediate**: Balanced compound and isolation exercises  
   - **Advanced**: Include progressive overload, supersets, drop sets, higher volume

3. ‚úÖ **Reps & Sets Based on Goal**
   - **Fat Loss**: 12‚Äì15 reps  
   - **Muscle Gain**: 8‚Äì12 reps  
   - **Strength**: 4‚Äì6 reps  
   - **General Fitness**: 8‚Äì12 reps

4. ‚úÖ **Workout Day Rules**
   - Start with compound lifts  
   - Follow with isolation exercises  
   - Avoid repeating the same muscle group two days in a row
