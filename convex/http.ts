Age: ${age}  
Height: ${height}  
Weight: ${weight}  
Injuries or limitations: ${injuries}  
Available workout days: ${workoutDays}  
Fitness goal: ${fitnessgoals}  
Fitness level: ${fitness_level} (Options: beginner, intermediate, advanced)

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Design a **weekly workout plan** that:
- Prioritizes **1 to 2 muscle groups per session only** ‚Äî NEVER full-body routines  
- Is progressive, safe, and tailored to the user‚Äôs fitness goal and level  
- Avoids training the same muscle group on consecutive days  
- Avoids exercises that could aggravate injuries

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è PROGRAM STRUCTURE:
Follow these standards strictly:

1. **Weekly Split**  
   - Choose the best split based on available days (e.g., Push/Pull/Legs, Upper-Lower, Bro-Split)  
   - NEVER assign full-body routines  
   - Each session must focus on **only one or two primary muscle groups**

2. **Exercise Selection Based on Level**
   - **Beginner**: Machine-based, bodyweight or stable movements, simple mechanics  
   - **Intermediate**: Compound + isolation mix, moderate complexity  
   - **Advanced**: High volume, progressive overload, supersets or drop sets allowed

3. **Reps & Sets Based on Fitness Goal**
   - **Fat loss**: Circuits or supersets, 12‚Äì15 reps  
   - **Muscle gain**: 8‚Äì12 reps, with progressive overload  
   - **Strength**: 4‚Äì6 reps, fewer exercises, more rest  
   - **General fitness**: 8‚Äì12 reps, moderate volume

4. **Workout Day Rules**
   - Begin each workout with compound movements  
   - Follow with isolation work  
   - Never repeat major muscles two days in a row

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SCHEMA INSTRUCTIONS:
- Your output MUST follow the exact JSON structure below
- "sets" and "reps" MUST always be NUMBERS ‚Äî not strings, descriptions, or text
- For cardio or circuits, use valid numbers like "sets": 1, "reps": 1

üö´ DO NOT include:
- Extra fields (like rest time, intensity, duration, equipment, notes, etc.)
- Any text outside the required JSON structure

============================================================

Return a valid JSON object using this **exact schema**:

  ]
}

============================================================

‚ùóIMPORTANT:
- Each day must target **no more than 2 muscle groups**
- NO full-body workouts allowed
- NO extra fields outside "day", "name", "sets", and "reps"
- Output ONLY the JSON object ‚Äî no extra text, no markdown, no explanations

Weight: ${weight}  
Fitness goal: ${fitnessgoals}  
Dietary restrictions: ${dietary_preferences}

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Design a **goal-oriented daily meal plan** tailored specifically to the user's needs (e.g., fat loss, muscle gain, or maintenance), using only foods that are common in Indian households.

As a top-level professional, ensure the following:
- ‚úÖ Accurately calculate total daily calorie needs based on age, height, weight, and goal using standard nutritional formulas (e.g., Mifflin-St Jeor or equivalent)
- ‚úÖ Align meals with the user‚Äôs fitness goal: energy deficit for fat loss, surplus for muscle gain, maintenance for balance
- ‚úÖ Ensure nutritional completeness ‚Äî each meal should reflect proper **macronutrient balance** (carbs, protein, fats)
- ‚úÖ Recommend only **readily available Indian foods** ‚Äî use ingredients found in a middle-class Indian household
- ‚úÖ Honor all **dietary restrictions** strictly (vegetarian, gluten-free, lactose-free, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Ensure **food diversity** ‚Äî avoid repetition across meals
- ‚úÖ Suggest foods that also support digestive health and long-term sustainability
- ‚úÖ Consider cultural taste preferences and seasonal adaptability

üö´ DO NOT include:
- Exotic, foreign, or expensive ingredients like quinoa, kale, tofu, almond milk, protein powders, salmon, etc.
- Supplements, macros, timing, portion sizes, calorie breakdowns, or explanations

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SCHEMA INSTRUCTIONS:
- Your output MUST strictly follow this JSON format
- dailyCalories must be a NUMBER (not a string or label)
- Each meal object must contain ONLY:
  ‚Ä¢ "name": the name of the meal (e.g., "Breakfast")
  ‚Ä¢ "foods": an array of food item strings

      "foods": ["Steamed rice", "Grilled paneer", "Spinach sabzi"]
    }
  ]
}

============================================================

üîí FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- DO NOT add any fields or metadata outside the above JSON format
- DO NOT include any text outside the JSON block
- All values in "foods" must be strings (no objects or explanations)
- Use ONLY culturally relevant Indian foods, as found in typical home-cooked meals
